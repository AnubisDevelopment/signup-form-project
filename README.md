# signup-form-project
This is the signup form project that I've worked on 
to practice my vanilla html and css skills in creating a page
for sign-ups. Since my live server is zoomed in 250%, in order
to make this visually appealing on a regularly zoomed in screen I
would multiply all sizing by 2.5%. 
Note: this page is not built responsively
and without flexibility in mind. It was just to get the blueprint 
of a site up and running. If I were to replicate this signup form again, 
I would build it responsively in the future.
